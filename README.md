2. Open the folder in your preferred terminal or code editor, such as VS Code.
3. Install the required npm packages by running the command `npm install` in both the `client` and `server` directories.
4. Start the server by running the command `npm run server`.
   - **Note**: Before running `npm run server`, make sure that you have created a file called `.env` in the server folder. Add the following keys with the correct details:
     - `MONGO_URL`: Put your MongoDB URL or local MongoDB URL.
     - `PORT`: Choose any port number (suggested: greater than 800).
     - `SECRET_KEY`: Choose any string, number, or special character as the secret key.
     - `my_email`: Put your Google email that has access to send mail using Nodemailer.
     - `my_password`: Put your Google App passwords. If you're unsure how to get a Google App password, please search online for more information.

6. Start the frontend by running the command `npm run start`.
   - Once the server is up and running, you can access the application locally at this URL: http://localhost:3000/.
   - Open the provided URL in any web browser to view and interact with the application.

By following these steps, you can easily set up and run the e-commerce application locally on your machine.
